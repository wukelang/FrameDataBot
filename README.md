# Bot Usage

`$fd` shows what games are currently supported by the bot.  
It is possible to enter game titles that are not shown, but they may not work.

`$fd [game]` shows all character names that belong to that game.

`$fd [game] [character]` shows the inputs of all moves belonging to that character.  
Note: to enter multi-word names, use "", e.g. "Ky Kiske".

`$fd [game] [character] [move]` shows the frame data of that move.  
Note: use "" for inputs with spaces, e.g. "236D > 4D".

# Todo

- ~~Create bot~~
- ~~Character name input leniency (e.g ky instead of Ky Kiske, aba instead of A.B.A, etc)~~ Only for GGACR.
- ~~Test if search works for different games on dustloop. Think of ways to scrape character names~~
- Make embeds for other outputs e.g character moves
- ~~Make embed prettier, use inline fields, make thumbnail image larger~~
- ~~Research interactive embed (to navigate through sequences, game > character > move)~~
- Use reacts to allow user to move through images ?
- ~~Test functionality for different games~~
- ~~Readme~~
- Find a way to host the bot
- Find out how a separate host can install framework requirements so the code can run
- Infil FG Terms Dictionary functionality ?
