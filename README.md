# Todo

- ~~Create bot~~
- ~~Character name input leniency (e.g ky instead of Ky Kiske, aba instead of A.B.A, etc)~~
- ~~Test if search works for different games on dustloop. Think of ways to scrape character names~~
- Make embeds for other outputs e.g character moves
- Make embed prettier, use inline fields, make thumbnail image larger
- Research interactive embed (to navigate through sequences, game > character > move)
- Use emojis to allow user to move through images ?
- Test functionality for different games
- Readme
- Find a way to host the bot
- Find out how a separate host can install framework requirements so the code can run
