# Todo

- Create bot
- Character name input leniency (e.g ky instead of Ky Kiske, aba instead of A.B.A, etc)
- Test if search works for different games on dustloop. Think of ways to scrape character names
- Research interactive embed (to navigate through sequences, game > character > move)
- Readme
- Find a way to host the bot
